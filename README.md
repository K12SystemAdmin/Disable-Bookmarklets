-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Bookmarklets or bookmarks are what most students use to bypass school restrictions. This can include disabling extensions that are installed on school computers or browsers. By utilizing bookmarklets or bookmarks, students can bypass the limitations imposed by certain extensions that might block or restrict access to specific websites or content. They can simply click on a bookmark or bookmarklet that disables these extensions temporarily, granting them access to restricted resources without being detected. However, it's important to remember that such actions go against the school's policies and are considered non-ethical. It's crucial for students to respect and abide by the rules set by their educational institution to maintain a safe and fair learning environment for everyone.
